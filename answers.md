1. What is the difference between new and create for a model?

New is the form/page to prompt you to create a new resource. Create is the endpoint to create a resource, where it becomes official and request gets sent.

.save command after creating a new instance of the object.

3. What is the column that exists on every table but we did NOT define?

4. What single line of ruby code can insert a cat with the name "hat" in the database?

5. What was the most confusing part over the last few weeks?

The most confusing part was figuring out all of the dependencies between routing, controllers, and views. I am still trying to grasp all of the commands as well as specific Ruby syntax to accomplish certain tasks.

6. How did you like this homework in comparison with the others?

This homework was very helpful as it gave walk-through steps just in case you were stuck on a part. Last homework I had a really hard time consolidating everything from the lecture for the homework and I didn't really learn much after completing it.
